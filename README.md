# Stoneshard-CraftableArrows
A mod for Stoneshard that lets the player buy and make arrows. 

Currently adding:
- **Charred-tip Arrows and Bolts:** these wood-only projectiles have simple fire-hardened tips, making them much weaker but also much cheaper compared to existing options.
- **Arrowheads:** all the three vanilla types, leafshaped, broadhead, and bodkin. They stack to 100 and can be bought and found in many different places. They make for convenient loot.
- **Hide Glue:** necessary to glue arrowheads onto charred-tip arrows or bolts, producing the respective ammo. Can be bought from tailors and, in smaller quantities, carpenters.
